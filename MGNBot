		is still in seedling or vegetative phase (>14 hours of light per day) you may see early sex indicators, but wait till pre-flower is \
		triggered to be sure.\
		Males will develop little ball-shaped pollen sacs, while females will develop pointy, teardrop-shaped growths that extrude fuzzy white \
		hairs called "pistils". Some plants may show signs of both sexes, we call these "hermaphrodites", or "hermies". \
